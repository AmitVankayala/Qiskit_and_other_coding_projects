# Qiskit_projects


This repository contains applications of Grover's algorithm to solve certain elementary Python problems. The is_Palindorme_finder_qiskit project's circuit finds palindromes amongst four letters which could potentially be applied for Genome sequencing and the is_Prime_finder_qiskit project's circuit finds prime numbers in a certain range. Both projects have their code based on Qiskit tutorials for Grover search algorithm and Quantum Counting algorithm. The attempt of this project is also to make the process of creating the ominous Quantum oracle a bit more intuitive.

Prerequisite :

To run the notebook locally:
[Install Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stable/0.24/install.html) on your system.

To run the notebook online:
Create [IBMQ account](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/login) and run the notebook by uploading the files.

Read the [Grover search algorithm](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html) and [Quantum Counting](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-counting.html) from the Qiskit tutorial. If you can understand the details of those algorithms you are good to go ahead and read this project.
